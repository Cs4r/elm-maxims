Maxims from http://www.infoq.com/articles/API-Design-Joshua-Bloch

Implemented as a 'service' with the intent to discover [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

To make: `elm make maxims.elm --output=index.html`

How to: use left/right arrows to navigate maxims. Next maxim is also displayed on clicks and every 30 seconds.
